		    <p>PlanIT Impact is a resource impact tool for the Planning, Building and Construction industry that automatically links locally available geospatial data with a specific development project’s location to easily and quickly provide visually immersive feedback. The idea is to allow the design and development process to be more information intensive earlier on, so that smarter decisions can be made before significant investment has occurred. </p>

			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			<p>Our goal is to create the most information rich,  user friendly and interactive app to help designers, planners and constituents  visualize scenarios of future development and better understand the impacts of  our current environs.  </p>
			<p>We are looking to  create an immersive, 3D virtual environment that is easily navigatable,  scalable, and editable and which provides visual layers of information  regarding the environmental, economic and social impacts. </p>

			<h2>PlanIT Impact Purpose</h2>
            <p>As a first of its kind platform, the PlanIT Impact web app would potentially change the way our municipal leaders and building industry professionals make decisions about where and how to invest in our communities. It also has the potential potential to be an enormously powerful educational tool for uses as broad as students learning about the environment to a research tool on how cities metabolize resources in order to work toward attaining a better equilibrium.</p>

			<h2>Our Team</h2>
		    <hr class="dashed">	
            <p>The team is led by Draw Architecture + Urban Design’s principal Dominique Davison and collaborators include Code for America’s Andrew Hyder and Black Ops Development, Abdul Syed of Geovitics,  Sarah Hebert of Curious Pixel, and Beth Dawson. Funded out of a Mozilla Ignite grant and largely developed out of the burgeoning open source, hackathon scene of Kansas City, PlanIT impact hopes to become a leading planning assessment tool to promote more sustainable, and even regenerative design.</p>
